# Apps

An app is a small interactive thing, a poll or a game room, that someone starts in a text or voice channel and others join. The platform owns everything around it (launcher, card, presence line, permissions, moderation); the app itself is a sandboxed bundle that talks to the page through a narrow message API.

This page covers the part that exists so far: the manifest every app ships, its validator, and the presence line.

## The manifest

Every version of every app is described by one JSON file, `manifest.json`. An author writes the source shape (no hashes); the packager hashes the bundle and writes the built shape, which the server stores as it is and never takes from a client.

Fields, in the order they appear:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `manifestVersion` | Version of the manifest format. Always `1` for now. |
| `id` | Permanent, globally unique app id (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, 3 to 32 characters). Never reused. Ids starting with `pqp-` belong to the first-party publisher. |
| `version` | Semantic version of this build, without `+build` metadata (two builds that differ only there would be one version to SemVer but two strings to the pin). Two builds with the same id and version must be byte-identical. |
| `publisher` | The publisher that owns the id. `pqp` is first-party. |
| `platformApi` | Version of the sandbox message API the app is written against. Only `1` exists. |
| `name`, `description` | i18n keys for the display name and the one-line launcher description. |
| `icon` | One icon id from the pqp set (`APP_ICON_IDS`). Never an upload or a URL. |
| `category` | `game`, `tool` or `emulator`. `emulator` gets extra review and is first-party only. |
| `channelTypes` | Where the app can start: `text`, `voice`, or both. |
| `players` | `min`, `max` (players above it become spectators when `spectators` is true, otherwise the join is refused) and `maxSpectators` (default 50). |
| `requires` | Permission to start (`USE_APPS` or `MANAGE_CHANNELS`) and to join (`VIEW_CHANNEL` or `CONNECT`). |
| `capabilities` | What the app asks of the platform, shown in the join sheet. See below. |
| `hostBound` | When true the session's truth lives on the host's machine, so it ends after the host-gone grace instead of passing the host role on. |
| `state` | `maxBytes` of shared session state (0 to 16384), `maxWritesPerSecond` (1 to 10, default 10) and `writers` (`host` or `participants`, default `participants`). |
| `events` | Ephemeral relay limits per participant: `maxPerSecond` (0 to 20) and `maxBytes` (0 to 1024). |
| `presence` | i18n keys of the status line for someone in the app: `phrase` (has one `{name}`) and `short` (no placeholder). |
| `content` | `userText` and `userImages`: whether participants put content in the app that other people see. Drives the community lock. |
| `notice` | Optional i18n key of one line shown in the join sheet. |
| `entry` | `path` of the entry HTML in the bundle, plus `sha256` in the built shape. |
| `assets` | Optional big files the page hands to the sandbox on request: `name`, `path`, and in the built shape `sha256` and `bytes`. |
| `sandbox` | Optional narrow knobs over the fixed CSP: `wasm` (adds `wasm-unsafe-eval`), `blobWorkers` (adds `worker-src blob:`; not needed by Locadora, kept for apps that run their own workers, reviewed) and `localBlobs` (adds `connect-src blob:` only, never the network). There is no free-text CSP and no network knob. |
| `platforms` | Where it runs: `web`, `desktop`, `ios`, `android`. Default `web` and `desktop`. |
| `license` | `spdx` expression, `source` URL (https) and an optional `notices` path. |
| `store` | Optional listing fields: `summary`, `screenshots` (path, alt, and a hash in the built shape), `homepage`, `support`. |
| `i18n` | Strings for `pt-BR`, `en` and `es`, all three required. Plain text, 240 characters at most per value. |

Capabilities:

| Capability | Values |
|---|---|
| `identity` | `display` (name, avatar and a random per-session seat id) or `user-id` (also a stable per-app derived id, only for people who consent). |
| `share` | `none`, or `pane` to let the host screen-share the app pane (voice channels only). |
| `localFiles` | `allowed`, and when allowed the `accept` extensions and a `maxBytes`. The page opens the picker and reads the bytes; the file name never crosses and nothing is uploaded. |
| `peer` | `none` or `datachannel`. Only `none` is accepted on `platformApi` 1. |

## Rules beyond the schema

`validateAppManifest` runs the schema and then these rules. Each failure has a stable `code` and a `path`.

| Code | Rule |
|---|---|
| `players-range` | `players.max` is at least `players.min`. |
| `i18n-missing-key` | Every referenced key (name, description, notice, both presence keys, store summary, screenshot alt) exists in pt-BR, en and es. |
| `presence-placeholder` | `presence.phrase` has exactly one `{name}` and no other braces, in every locale. |
| `presence-short-placeholder` | `presence.short` has no `{`, in every locale. |
| `em-dash` | No i18n value contains an em dash. |
| `pt-br-voce` | No pt-BR value uses the word "você" or "voce" (pqp speaks "tu"). |
| `publisher-reserved-id` | An id starting with `pqp-` requires publisher `pqp`. |
| `publisher-emulator` | Category `emulator` requires publisher `pqp`. |
| `peer-unsupported` | `capabilities.peer` is `none` while `platformApi` is 1. |
| `local-files-accept-required`, `local-files-max-bytes-required` | When `localFiles.allowed` is true, `accept` and `maxBytes` are present. |
| `local-files-unexpected` | When it is false, they are absent. |
| `share-needs-voice` | `share: "pane"` requires `voice` in `channelTypes`. |
| `state-writers-no-state` | `state.writers: "host"` with `state.maxBytes: 0` has nothing to write. |

Schema failures use `schema-unknown-key`, `schema-required`, `schema-type`, `schema-enum`, `schema-format`, `schema-range` and `schema-unique`.

## The presence line

`formatAppPresence(template, displayName)` puts a person's name into the app's translated phrase ("Raf tá na Locadora"). The name is untrusted text a stranger typed, so control characters and bidi override and isolate characters are removed, it is trimmed and capped at 32 characters, and the substitution is a plain splice: `$&` stays literal and a name containing `{name}` is not expanded. An empty name becomes `?`. `resolveAppPresence(manifest, locale, displayName)` picks the locale (exact, then base language, then English) and returns the `phrase` for places where the line stands alone and the `short` for places under a name that is already shown.

## Availability

An app may run in a place only when every gate holds. `appAvailability(serverId, appId, { channelType })` in `server/src/apps/availability.ts` answers `{ available, reason }`, and `reason` is the FIRST gate that fails, in this order:

| Reason | Gate |
|---|---|
| `flag-off` | The runtime flag `apps` is off for the server. |
| `not-live` | `apps.status` is not `live`, or the app has no current version. |
| `global-off` | `apps.global_enabled` (the operator's master switch) is off. |
| `not-allowed-here` | `server_apps.operator_enabled` is not TRUE for this server. |
| `owner-off` | The server's owner set `server_apps.owner_enabled` to FALSE. The owner can only remove what the operator allowed. |
| `community-locked` | The server is a public community (`servers.is_community`) and the app has no `community_unlocked` safety decision. |
| `emulator-off` | `category: "emulator"` also needs the flag `emulator_room` on the server. |
| `channel-type` | The channel's type (`text` or `voice`) is not in the manifest's `channelTypes`. |
| `no-origin` | The deployment has no `APPS_ORIGIN`, so no app can run. |

D14: `appShareAllowed(serverId, app)` is true for every app except `category: "emulator"`, which also needs the flag `locadora_share` on the server (per server, default off, waiting for the lawyer's answer). The config carries it as `shareAllowed` and the session engine refuses `share.request` and spectator joins without it.

### The apps origin

`APPS_ORIGIN` names the separate, cookieless site that serves bundles (hosted: `https://pqp-apps.pages.dev`, local: `http://localhost:5175`). Unset, the config answers `origin: null` and every app is `no-origin`. Bundle addresses are `<origin>/<id>/<version>/<path>`, built by the server from the stored manifest, never from a request.

### The catalog

`server/src/apps/catalog.json` (`{ "apps": [ { "manifest": <built manifest>, "manifestSha256": "<hex>" } ] }`, written by the packager) is merged into `apps` and `app_versions` at boot by `loadAppCatalog`, on the API and the worker. The merge is insert-only: a new app arrives as `draft`, off everywhere, and a new version as `pending` review; the same (id, version) with a different `manifestSha256` is refused with a loud log; nothing ever changes the status, switches, review fields or `current_version` of an existing row, except that an app with no `current_version` gets the newest version the load inserted. Every insert writes an `app_admin_audit` row (`catalog-load`). The build copies the file into `dist/apps/`.

On a dev box only (`DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` and `NODE_ENV` not `production`) apps of the `pqp` publisher are made `live`, `global_enabled` and `community_unlocked` at load, and the dev seed releases them on its Sandbox server, so a local checkout needs no dashboard. Turn the platform itself on with `APPS=true` in `.env`, and set `APPS_ORIGIN`.

### The config route

`GET /api/apps/config?serverId=` (member of the server, otherwise 404) answers `{ enabled, origin, apps }`, typed by `appsConfigSchema` in `packages/shared/src/apps/config.ts`. With the flag off, or with no `serverId`, it is `{ enabled: false, origin: null, apps: [] }`. Each `live` app is listed with `available` and `reason`, the entry and asset URLs, `shareAllowed`, and only the i18n keys a client draws (name, description, notice, presence) in all three locales.

### Who may start

`USE_APPS` is on `@everyone` of every server created from now on (`PERMISSION_NEW_SERVER_EVERYONE`), and on the moderator, manager and admin staff roles, which is what a new server is seeded with. It is not in `PERMISSION_DEFAULT_EVERYONE`, so a community only has it when its owner grants it.

## Where things live

- Zod schemas, validator and constants: `packages/shared/src/apps/manifest.ts`
- Presence formatter: `packages/shared/src/apps/presence.ts`
- JSON Schema for third parties: `packages/shared/schemas/app-manifest-1.schema.json`
- Fixtures: `packages/shared/fixtures/app-manifests/` (`valid-*`, `invalid-schema-*` rejected by both schemas, `invalid-rule-*` accepted by the JSON Schema and rejected by the validator)
- Tests: `packages/shared/src/apps/*.test.ts`. The parity test runs both schemas over every fixture, so the JSON file and the zod schema cannot drift apart. Change one, change the other, add a fixture.
- Availability, catalog, config: `server/src/apps/{availability,catalog,config,origin}.ts`, route in `server/src/api/app-routes.ts`, client contract `packages/shared/src/apps/config.ts`
